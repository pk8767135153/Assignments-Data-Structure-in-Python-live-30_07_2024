    "A Bagging Classifier is an ensemble method that combines multiple versions of a base classifier trained on different bootstrap samples (random subsets of the original dataset with replacement) of the training data. The predictions from each base classifier are aggregated (by majority vote for classification) to produce the final prediction. This approach reduces variance and helps improve the overall accuracy of the model.\n",

    "- **Confusion Matrix**: A table that summarizes the performance by showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Splitting the data into multiple folds and assessing the model’s performance across these folds to get a robust estimate of its performance.\n",
