    "\n",
    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by providing a clear and simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. The new class, known as a subclass, can also have additional properties and methods or override the inherited ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The most common use of polymorphism is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making it easier to add new functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created¹²³."

    "1. Importing Modules: We import the `time` module to measure the execution time and `wraps` from `functools` to preserve the original function's metadata.\n",
    "2. Decorator Function `timeit`: \n",
    "   - The `timeit` function takes another function `func` as an argument.\n",
    "   - Inside `timeit`, we define a `timeit_wrapper` function that wraps the original function `func`.\n",
    "   - `timeit_wrapper` records the start time before calling `func` and the end time after `func` completes.\n",
    "   - It calculates the total execution time and prints it.\n",
    "   - Finally, it returns the result of the original function `func`.\n",
    "3. Using the Decorator: \n",
    "   - We use the `@timeit` syntax to apply the decorator to `example_function`.\n",
    "   - When `example_function` is called, the `timeit_wrapper` function is executed, measuring and printing the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decorator can be applied to any function to measure its execution time, making it a versatile tool for performance profiling."
